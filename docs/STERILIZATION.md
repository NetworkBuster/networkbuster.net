# Sterilization & Decontamination (Aerospace Instruments)

**Context:** A common real-world scene is discovering a dirty, weathered car with someone sheltering inside. Before approaching or cleaning anything, prioritize the safety and dignity of any occupant — do **not** disturb them without consent. Contact local outreach or social services for support and obtain explicit permission before handling personal effects or equipment. If an instrument is suspected to be contaminated (biohazard or chemical), defer to institutional biosafety/OSH procedures and qualified personnel.

> **Important safety note:** Aerospace instruments are precision devices. Always consult the manufacturer's maintenance and contamination control guidance before cleaning. When in doubt, move the instrument to a controlled environment (lab/cleanroom) for decontamination and functional verification.

## Quick scene assessment (before any cleaning)
1. Ensure the area is safe and stable. If someone is present, introduce yourself, explain intent, and ask permission to inspect the item.
2. If any hazardous materials, bodily fluids, or biological contamination is suspected, **stop** and contact the appropriate safety officer or public health authority.
3. Document the instrument (photos, serial, model) before touching it.
4. If feasible, transfer the instrument to a clean, ventilated area or lab for controlled work.

## Step-by-step sterilization / decontamination (general safe procedure)
1. Prepare PPE and supplies: nitrile gloves, N95 respirator or PAPR, safety goggles/face shield, disposable gowns or coveralls, shoe covers, and waste bags.
2. Pre-clean (mechanical): remove gross debris, dust, and foreign matter with soft brushes and lint-free wipes. Avoid forcing debris into vents or connectors.
3. Isolation: power down the instrument and remove batteries/power sources when safe. Shield or mask optical/sensor surfaces.
4. Surface disinfection (electronics-safe): use lint-free wipes moistened with 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and gently wipe external enclosures and non-porous surfaces. For sensitive optics, follow manufacturer-approved optical cleaning fluids and procedures.
5. Crevices and connectors: use sterile swabs lightly moistened with IPA to clean crevices and connector shells — **do not** introduce liquids into connectors or open electronics.
6. HEPA-filtered local ventilation: when possible, perform cleaning with a local HEPA air cleaner to reduce airborne particulates.
7. UV-C (optional supplement): UV-C may reduce microbial load on exposed surfaces — use only as a supplement and follow strict safety protocols (avoid human exposure, follow irradiance/time guidance). UV-C is not a substitute for mechanical cleaning and does not penetrate materials.
8. Disposal: place used wipes, gowns, and contaminated consumables in sealed biohazard or waste bags as required; label and dispose according to local regulations.
9. Drying & curing: allow surfaces to dry fully (follow chemical dwell times); do not re-power until alcohol is fully evaporated.
10. Functional check: after cleaning and reassembly, perform operational and calibration checks in a controlled environment; document results and any deviations.

## When to escalate
- Any suspected biological contamination (blood, bodily fluids): stop and escalate to biosafety/public health.
- Instrument shows abnormal behavior after cleaning: stop use and contact manufacturer or qualified technician.

## Empathy & ethics
- Respect the belongings and privacy of people experiencing homelessness. If you find instruments or items that may belong to someone sheltering in a vehicle, ask for consent and offer resources instead of immediately discarding personal items.
