# Lunar Environmental Conditions - NLRS Design Parameters

## Executive Summary

The lunar surface presents one of the most challenging operational environments for machinery and systems. This document compiles comprehensive environmental data that drives the design requirements for the NetworkBuster Lunar Recycling System (NLRS).

## 1. Atmospheric Conditions

### 1.1 Vacuum Environment

**Surface Pressure**: 3 × 10⁻¹⁵ bar (10⁻¹⁵ atm)
- Effectively perfect vacuum
- ~100 trillion times less dense than Earth's atmosphere
- No convective heat transfer
- No aerodynamic forces

**Exosphere Composition** (trace amounts):
- Helium (He): 25%
- Neon (Ne): 25%
- Hydrogen (H₂): 23%
- Argon (Ar): 20%
- Methane (CH₄), Ammonia (NH₃), CO₂: <5%

- Atoms from micrometeorite impacts

**Engineering Implications**:

### 1.2 Radiation Environment

**Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR)**:
- Flux: 4-5 particles/cm²/second
- Energy: 100 MeV to >10 GeV
- Composed of: 85% protons, 14% alpha particles, 1% heavy ions
- Continuous exposure (no magnetic field protection)

- Particle flux: 10³-10⁶ particles/cm²/second during events
- Duration: Hours to days
- Energy: 10-100 MeV (primarily protons)
- Can cause single-event upsets (SEU) in electronics

**Secondary Neutrons**:
- Generated by cosmic rays hitting lunar surface
- Flux: 1-2 neutrons/cm²/second
- Particularly damaging to electronics

**Total Radiation Dose**:

## 2. Thermal Environment

### 2.1 Temperature Extremes

**Surface Temperature Range**:

- Transition periods: Rapid temperature change (~10°C/hour)

**Polar Regions**:
- Permanently shadowed craters: -240°C to -170°C
- Peaks of eternal light: -50°C to +0°C (more stable)

**Subsurface Temperatures**:

- Stefan-Boltzmann law: P = εσA(T⁴ - T_ambient⁴)
- Emissivity (ε) critical: 0.05 (polished metal) to 0.95 (black paint)
- Radiative cooling is slow but reliable

**Conduction**:
- Through mechanical interfaces
- Regolith contact: Poor thermal conductor (0.001-0.01 W/m·K)
- Metal interfaces: Good, but require contact pressure

**Design Strategies**:
- **Reject Heat**: High-emissivity surfaces (black or white paint)
- **Retain Heat**: Low-emissivity surfaces (polished metal, MLI)
- **Thermal Switches**: Louvers or variable-emissivity coatings

- Dust and particles behave differently (longer airtime, different trajectories)

**Separation Processes**:
- Gravity-based separation 6× slower
- Ballistic trajectories extended
- Centrifugal force more effective relatively
- Settling times greatly increased

**Structural Loads**:

- Reduced seismic concerns? (no tectonic activity, but meteorite impacts)

**Human/Robotic Operations**:
- Different ergonomics for maintenance
- Tools and procedures adapted

### 3.2 Orbital Mechanics
